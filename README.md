#### Insole pressure sensor project

### Hardware

#### Insole sensor

Started with [this material](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1361) but it did not work so well.  

Switched to [this piezoresistive material](http://www.sensorfilmkit.com) which is described in detail in [this article](reference/material-reference.pdf)

The sensor is a 5-layer design 

* Insulator
* Electrode
* Piezoresistive
* Electrode
* Insulator

#### Microcontroller

Prototyping is mostly done with an arduino uno. 
Will then switch to a [BLE enabled feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-bluefruit-le/). 


### Software

Visualization during debugging is done via processing. 


### Notes 

'Reynolds heavy duty aluminum foil' needs to be cut with pressure=3, speed=1, 'writing paper' setting in cameo
